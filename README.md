# Project 8 - Accessibility Refactor

**Treehouse Tech Degree Project** - Take a set of interlinked pages that suffer from various accessibility flaws and refine and update them so they are accessible and pass an accessibility validator(s)'s automated checks and a human's check.

For this project you will modify the website files provided for the rock band “Accessible Frog" to improve the site's accessibility for users. 

- Ensure links are visually distinct.
  - Add hover state to links.
  - Ensure the image link icons in the footer have accompanying text describing the link. However we don’t want to see this text on the page. Think about using alt text for the image or using css styling to hide text describing the image link. 
- Create a table for the tour dates information using the <td> element for table data cells and the <th> element for table header cells.
  - Ensure your table has a scope and caption element. 
- Ensure form elements have styled focus states using the :focus pseudo class.
  - Add associated labels for form controls.
  - Make sure all labels have a ‘for’ value. Matching for and id values associate the label with the appropriate form control.
  - Group form elements with a fieldset.
  - Add a legend to describe the grouping.
  - Ensure the select field options are in alphabetical order.
  - Make sure you can select options in the drop-down menu by typing from the keyboard. 
- Checking your code:
  - Check your code using the Chrome Accessibility extension and the Fangs extension for Firefox. You can also copy and paste your HTML into the Accessibility Validator (see the Project Resources section for link).
  - You will also need to check your code against the Accessibility Checklist (see the Project Resources section for link).
